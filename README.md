# My-Udagram-Project

The essence of this project is to demonstrate how flexible and expedient applications can easily be deployed to the cloud without having to deal with the operational overhead involved when provisioning and managing virtual servers (EC2 instances, as in the case of AWS).

AWS PaaS offering; Elastic Beanstalk is the service that simplifies and achieves the objective of deploying applications without having to manually spin up servers,install operating systems,patch,and perform other related system jobs to prepare an instance for its workload in the cloud. This affords any organization or business entity to dedicate more time on what distinguishes its business and increase productivity rather than performing repetitive infrastructural jobs that do not add to the value of its operation.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is beneficial for a myriad of use cases that offers business value. These include but are not limited to the following

i. An application is able to withstand a surge in traffic due to the inclusion of autoscaling in the Elastic Beanstalk service

ii. Elastic beanstalk allows for the application to be easily and simply rolled back to previous versions as well. This is very instrumental to keep the most stable version of an application in production whiles new updates can be worked on and  packaged to be shipped when they are ready for the production environment with various options for deployment as well.

iii. Itâ€™s also compatible with Linux and windows OS in server environments.

iv. In addition, a wide variety of programming languages are supported in Elastic Beanstalk. These include node.js,ruby,python,Java and PHP to list just a few.

v. The load balancer provisioned by elastic beanstalk to be the gateway to an application can also be configured with a HTTPS protocol to ensure security by allowing traffic from specific ports.



# Getting Started

The source code for this project can be found on the development branch(dev) of this repository. 

A.Setup Node Environment
  
You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:

1.Initialize a new project: npm i

2.run the development server with npm run dev


B. Create a new endpoint in the server.ts file
There is an endpoint in ./src/server.ts which uses query parameter to download an image from a public URL, filter the image, and return the result.

3. Deploying your system
Follow the process described in the course to eb init a new application and eb create a new environment to deploy your image-filter service! Don't forget you can use eb deploy to push changes.
